    """
    RestResource is a Twisted Resource() object that can be used with the
    twisted eco-system.  RestResource is meant to be an abstract class
    that can be used to implement your own rest-like resource types.
    
    See ``txrest.json.JsonResource`` for an implemented example.
    
    When you implement a **RestResource()** class it should look like this::
    
    The ``render_*`` methods have been replaced with ``rest_*`` to
    distinguish between our methods, and the super-classes methods.
    
    The resolution of methods, and errors is handled in this abstract class.
    This replaces logic to handle all render methods, and then call
    rest, rest_GET, rest_POST, rest_PUT, rest_DELETE methods
    
    To implement a subclass/interface you must define a resource class first
    with a signature similar to ``class JsonResource(RestResource):``
    
    Next you must define these **class attributes**
    
    :ACCEPT: The accept header that will be returned to clients.
    :CONTENT_TYPE: The content type header that will be returned to clients...
                   must contain a ``%s`` where encoding should appear such as:
                   ``application/json; charset=%s``
    :HANDLE_TYPES: A tuple or list of types we will handle.
    :ERROR_CLASS: A class reference to twisted.web.resource.ErrorPage or a 
                  subclass thereof
    
    Next you must define these functions:
    
    ``def _format_post(self, request, body, encoding):`` - receives a string (body) and a desired internal
    encoding (encoding) and should return a data-object that is expected by the 
    second argument in ``rest_POST(request, post_data)`` definitions.
    
    ``def _format_response(self, request, response, encoding):`` - receives a data-type defind in the
    class attribute ``HANDLE_TYPES`` and serializes to a byte string that can be written to
    the client.  Encoding is the requested encoding of the resulting string.
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    This class popualtes the request variable ``method_called`` to the name of 
    the method that was actually called to handle the request. 
    
    We populate the request variable ``recursion`` to an integer that keeps track of
    resource rendering recursion.
    
    We populate the request variable ``started`` to an epoch at the request start time.
